    <p>My very first day at tech4girls was an exciting one. A lot was learnt and i'm looking forward to more of this. Fast forward,
    we started learning about how to design with figma, how to use html and style with css, and now on javascript. Even though 
    not an easy one, it gets to be more fun with lots of practice.</p>
